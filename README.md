# breakout

Creates breakout groups for a set of people ensuring each person gets to chat with all others.

This code is bad, but it maybe works.

For now, this is hard-coded to a set of 12 people in groups of 3.

If you don't want to install go you can play around with the program at go.dev/play by copy-pasting the code in there.
I've already done that for v0 here: https://go.dev/play/p/g0hOv64W57T

Alternatively install go and run `go run breakout.go`
